//The Tilt Profile Card project is a visually engaging web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to enhance the traditional profile card concept by incorporating a dynamic 3D tilt effect. HTML is employed for structuring the content, CSS is utilized to style and layout elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity to implement the unique tilt animation.

Users can experience an immersive visual effect as they hover over the profile card, causing it to respond dynamically with a subtle tilt. This interactive feature adds a touch of modernity and creativity to the traditional profile card design. The project showcases the seamless integration of these three technologies to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience, making it an engaging way to present personal or professional information on a webpage.
